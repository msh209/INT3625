However, there is a way to compute trigonometric functions, e.g. the $\\sin$ function, using only elementary operations based on math that we already know. This would involve using Taylor series. From the theory of the course we know that the $\\sin$ function can be written as:\n",

    "Given two vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$, and two scalars $a$ and $b$, compute the linear combination $\\mathbf{w} = a \\mathbf{u} + b \\mathbf{v}$.\n",

    "    - Takes two positional arguments, representing the vectors\n",
    "    - Takes two keyword arguments with default values 1, representing the scalars\n",
    "    - Computes and returns as a result the linear combination $a \\mathbf{u} + b \\mathbf{v}$\n",
    "* **Task 3** Add a conditional statement before the computation to ensure that both provided vectors are of the same size. If not, increase the size of the smaller vector to match the larger and set the value of all new elements to 0"
