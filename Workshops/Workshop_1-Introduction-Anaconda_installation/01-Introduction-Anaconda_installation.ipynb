    "   - All the commands/theory needed, plus some additional related material\n",
    "   - Code examples\n",
    "   - Where necessary, useful resources for further reading\n",
    "   - The description of the problem to be solved\n",
    "* Alternatively, the exercises will be presented in the form of pdf, html or alternative file format such as markdown and the Spyder debugger will be used to code (I will show the Spyder IDE later in the classroom):\n",
    "   - If so; the commands/theory needed will be contained in the relative format as mentioned above. \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Workshops will usually begin with a review of the required theory and commands, these reviews:\n",
    "   - Will be more extensive in the first few workshops\n",
    "   - Will contain more example coding in further workbooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some workshops will only involve short assignments to practice the material taught in previous workshops, these:\n",
    "    - Can range in difficulty from very basic to more advanced\n",
    "    - Will allow you to focus on the parts that you might find more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main part of each of the first 5 workshops will involve the solution of some problem using python, these problems:\n",
    "   - Will not always be related to the corresponding theory lecture.\n",
    "   - Will aim at highlighting specific Python skills appropriate to data science.\n",
    "   - You will be learning the fundamentals of programming in these first weeks of workbooks. \n",

    "Programming languages can be categorised based on different characteristics. While the topic is quite complicated, here we will only mention two characteristics that are useful to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first characteristic is related to how the code written in each language is executed and, based on this, we can distinguish the following types of programming languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compiled**. In this category of languages, a software, known as **compiler**, reads a file or files containing the original code, known as **source code** and converts it into a machine-understandable executable file, which the user has to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpreted**. In this category, each individual line of code is read by a software, known as **interpreter**, and executed directly. In this category, the user typically needs to run the interpreter in order to execute code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    " The difference between the above categories is similar to the difference between the translation of a document, which takes place once the original document has been written and results in another document (this is compiled), and the live translation of an interview, which is performed sentence by sentence while the interviewee is speaking (this is interpreted).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"> \n",

    "A second characteristic, based on which we can distinguish programming languages, is related to the level of abstraction from details of the hardware, or in other words how close the language is to machine code. In general, higher level languages tend to use simpler syntax and are easier for humans to understand than low level languages. On the other hand, low level languages, being closer to the hardware, offer more control on how the code is executed and as a result can offer better performance. Python is a high level language and the constructs and syntax are familiar to other high level languages in that they will be recognisable to students that have some coding experience in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to illustrate the difference between high and low level languages, here is the same program written in three different languages, ordered from high to low level:\n",
