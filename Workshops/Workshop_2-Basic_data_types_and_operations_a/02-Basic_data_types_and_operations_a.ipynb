    "## Data types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built in Python data types. There are more but these are the main ones.....\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports several data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integers \n",
    "  - Integer numbers\n",
    "  - For example: `1`, `2`, `3`\n",
    "* Floats\n",
    "  - Floating point numbers\n",
    "  - For example: `2.32`, `0.006`\n",
    "* Complex\n",
    "  - Complex numbers\n",
    "  - For example: `4+5j`, `2j`\n",
    "* Booleans\n",
    "  - Logical variables that only assume the values: `True`, `False`\n",
    "* Strings:\n",
    "  - Sequences of characters\n",
    "  - For example: `'Hello'`, `'Apple pie'`, `'ENG1002 is an awesome course!'`\n",
    "* Lists:\n",
    "  - Sequences of items of the same or different data type\n",
    "  - For example: `[1,2,5,7]`, `['John','David','Elizabeth']`, `[1,25.3,'Anna', True]`\n",
    "  - Empty lists can also be created as: `[]`\n",
    "* Dictionaries:\n",
    "  - Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.\n",
    "  - For example: mydict = {'name': 'john','code':6734, 'dept': 'sales'}\n",
    "  - Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces { } and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces []\n",
