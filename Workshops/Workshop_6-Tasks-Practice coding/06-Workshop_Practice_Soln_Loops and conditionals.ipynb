    "\n",
    "Computers can only perform a few basic operations. Have you ever wondered how can your calculator compute trigonometric, exponential and other complicated functions? Would you be able to write a python function returning the sinus or cosinus of an angle?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some insight**\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are different methods and algorithms that allow the computation of these functions using only elementary operations. For trigonometric functions in particular, the [CORDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC#:~:text=CORDIC%20(for%20COordinate%20Rotation%20DIgital,efficient%20algorithm%20to%20calculate%20trigonometric)) algorithm is typically used, which relies on vector rotations. However, there is a way to compute trigonometric functions, e.g. the $\\sin$ function, using only elementary operations based on math that we already know. This would involve using Taylor series. From the theory of the course we know that the $\\sin$ function can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sin\\left( x \\right) = x - \\dfrac{x^{3}}{3!} + \\dfrac{x^{5}}{5!} - \\dfrac{x^{7}}{7!} + \\dots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be written also as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sin\\left( x \\right) = \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{\\left( -1 \\right)^n}{\\left(2n+1 \\right)!} x^{2n+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be more accurate close to 0, and become less and less accurate away from it\n",
    "* Become more accurate if more terms are added\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also illustrated in the figures below:\n",
    "\n",
    "[]()                    |[]()                       \n",

    "![](./Figures/sine2.png)   |  ![](./Figures/sine4.png) \n",
    "![](./Figures/sine8.png)   |  ![](./Figures/sine16.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the sine function is periodic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sin\\left( x + 2\\pi \\right) = \\sin\\left( x \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we only need to compute it accurately within the interval $\\left[0,2\\pi \\right]$. For values outside this interval, we can exploit this periodicity by shifting the values of $x$ by multiples of $2\\pi$ and returning the corresponding value of the function from within this interval.\n",
