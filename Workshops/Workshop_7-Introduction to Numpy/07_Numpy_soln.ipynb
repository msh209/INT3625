    "An ellipse is defined as a set of points for which, the sum of the distances from two points, called focal points, is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of an ellipse in Cartesian coordinates is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dfrac{x^2}{a^2} + \\dfrac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$\n",

    "- **Task 1:** Define variables `a`, `b` and `n` with initial values of your choice\n",
    "- **Task 2:** Create a Numpy array with `n` evenly spaced values in the interval $\\left[0, 2\\pi\\right]$ to store angles $\\theta_i$. You can create this array using `linspace`.\n",
    "- **Task 3:** Using Numpy trigonometric functions and operations, compute the coordinates of points on the ellipse circumference. These coordinates should be stored in two individual Numpy arrays.\n",
    "- **Task 4:** Use Numpy operations and slicing to compute the differences $x_{i+1} - x_{i}$ and $y_{i+1} - y_{i}$ that are required for the evaluation of the linear segment lengths. These differences should be stored in new Numpy arrays.\n",
    "- **Task 5:** Compute the lengths of the linear segments using the previously obtained difference arrays and Numpy operations. These lengths should also be stored in a Numpy array.\n",
    "- **Task 6:** Compute and print the circumference of the ellipse as the sum of the previously computed lengths. You can do that using the `sum` Numpy function.\n",
    "- **Task 7:** Compare the obtained circumference with the one computed using the tool in this [link](https://www.google.com/search?q=ellipse+circumference&oq=ellipse+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j35i39j0i131i433i457j0i433l2j0j46j0.2661j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Check whether the accuracy of your approximation increases by increasing the number of points used."
